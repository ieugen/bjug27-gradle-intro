// Tasks are easy to define
task hello {
  println 'Hello world'
}

// And you can do that in multiple ways, which is confusing at first
task hello2

hello2 {
    println 'Hello world again'
}

task taskWithActions

// You can add actions to tasks using two methods. They work the same.
taskWithActions {
  doFirst {
    println 'Action: Show me first'
  }
  doLast {
    println 'Action: Show me last 1'
  }
}

// shorthand to doLast
taskWithActions << {
  println 'Action: Show me last 2'
}
